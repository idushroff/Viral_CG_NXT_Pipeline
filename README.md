README for Nextflow Viral Consensus Genome Pipeline
This pipeline is designed to process viral sequencing data, from raw paired-end FASTQ files to a consensus genome using tools such as BWA, iVar, and Samtools. It demonstrates an automated workflow with Nextflow, starting from sequence alignment to primer trimming and final consensus generation. This process can be particularly useful for analyzing viral datasets, such as tiled amplicon sequencing data.

Overview
This Nextflow pipeline consists of the following steps:

Download paired FASTQ files from NCBI (use #5 dataset from the benchmarking repository).

Align the reads to the reference genome using BWA-MEM2 and sort the resulting BAM file using Samtools.

Trim primers from the aligned BAM file using iVar and a BED file for primer coordinates.

Generate a consensus genome using iVar and output a FASTA file with the consensus sequence.

Prerequisites
Before running the pipeline, make sure the following software and tools are available:

Nextflow: Nextflow Installation Guide

Docker (for containerized execution of tools like BWA-MEM2, Samtools, and iVar): Docker Installation Guide

Reference Files:

Download the reference FASTA file from the NCBI or your preferred source.

Download the BED file that contains primer coordinates.

Obtain raw paired-end FASTQ files (can be downloaded from NCBI or another source).

File Structure
Make sure your project directory has the following structure:

csharp
Copy
Edit
project_directory/
│
├── data/
│   ├── fastq/
│   │   ├── SRR000001_1.fastq.gz
│   │   └── SRR000001_2.fastq.gz
│   ├── nCoV-2019.reference.fasta
│   └── nCoV-2019.bed
│
└── results/  (This directory will be populated with results)
Configuration
In the pipeline, several parameters can be customized:

groovy
Copy
Edit
params.ref_fasta = "${workflow.projectDir}/data/nCoV-2019.reference.fasta"
params.bed_file  = "${workflow.projectDir}/data/nCoV-2019.bed"
params.out_dir   = "${workflow.projectDir}/results"

params.ivar_min_qual    = 20  // Minimum quality score threshold for ivar consensus
params.ivar_min_depth   = 30  // Minimum depth threshold for ivar consensus
params.ivar_freq_thresh = 0.6 // Frequency threshold for ivar consensus
You can modify these parameters in the nextflow.config file or directly within the pipeline script, depending on your preferences.

How to Run the Pipeline
Clone the Repository:
If the pipeline is not yet downloaded, clone the repository (or get the script as a .nf file).

Run the Pipeline:
Once you have Nextflow installed and the project files are set up, you can run the pipeline with the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
nextflow run viral_consensus.nf
Outputs:
The output files (sorted BAM, trimmed BAM, and consensus FASTA) will be stored in the results/ directory.

Step-by-Step Breakdown
1. Align and Sort Reads (ALIGN_AND_SORT process)
This process aligns the paired-end reads to the reference genome using bwa-mem2 and sorts the resulting BAM file using samtools.

groovy
Copy
Edit
process ALIGN_AND_SORT {
    tag "$sample_id"
    container = 'ghcr.io/tgen/containers/bwa_mem2_samtools:2.2.1-23080315'

    input:
    tuple val(sample_id), file(reads)

    output:
    tuple val(sample_id), file("${sample_id}.sorted.bam")

    script:
    """
    zcat ${reads[0]} > ${sample_id}_1.fastq
    zcat ${reads[1]} > ${sample_id}_2.fastq

    bwa-mem2 index ${params.ref_fasta}
    bwa-mem2 mem -t 4 ${params.ref_fasta} ${sample_id}_1.fastq ${sample_id}_2.fastq | \
        samtools view -bS - | samtools sort -o ${sample_id}.sorted.bam
    """
}
2. Trim Primers (TRIM_IVAR process)
This step uses ivar trim to trim primer sequences from the BAM file based on coordinates provided in the BED file.

groovy
Copy
Edit
process TRIM_IVAR {
    tag "$sample_id"
    container = 'community.wave.seqera.io/library/ivar:1.4.4--89c11d667b4e27d1'

    input:
    tuple val(sample_id), file(sorted_bam)

    output:
    tuple val(sample_id), file("${sample_id}.trimmed.bam")

    script:
    """
    samtools index ${sorted_bam}
    ivar trim -i ${sorted_bam} -b ${params.bed_file} -p ${sample_id}.trimmed -m ${params.ivar_min_depth}
    """
}
3. Generate Consensus Genome (CONSENSUS_IVAR process)
This process generates the final consensus genome from the trimmed BAM file using ivar consensus and outputs the result as a .fasta file.

groovy
Copy
Edit
process CONSENSUS_IVAR {
    tag "$sample_id"
    container = 'community.wave.seqera.io/library/ivar:1.4.4--89c11d667b4e27d1'

    input:
    tuple val(sample_id), file(trimmed_bam)

    output:
    file("${sample_id}.consensus.fasta")

    script:
    """
    samtools mpileup -A -d 0 --reference ${params.ref_fasta} ${trimmed_bam} | \
        ivar consensus -p ${sample_id}.consensus -q ${params.ivar_min_qual} -t ${params.ivar_freq_thresh} -m ${params.ivar_min_depth}

    mv ${sample_id}.consensus.fa ${sample_id}.consensus.fasta
    """
}
Final Challenge: Writing a Nextflow Pipeline
Once you've manually processed a small viral dataset and generated a consensus genome using tools like BWA, Samtools, and iVar, the final challenge is to automate these steps using a Nextflow pipeline. This script should take raw fastq files as input, align them, trim primers, and generate a consensus genome, similar to the pipeline outlined above.

Troubleshooting and Notes
Memory/CPU Requirements: Depending on your dataset size, you might need to adjust memory and CPU allocation for the processes.

File Paths: Ensure that your file paths (for FASTQ, reference, and BED files) are correct and accessible by the pipeline.

Container Usage: If you're running the pipeline with Docker or Singularity, ensure your environment supports the required container engines.
